selector is only to read the data and give a name to state

store.select is for selectors and store.dispatch is for actions

1. create a variable in state
2. create action for it with required props, createAction method takes a string and props
3. implement the necessary action in reducer
4. dispatch the action from component if data needs to be stored in state
5. subscribe to the store if data is to be read
6. for reading data we need to create read operation in selector

how to do CRUD in ngrx:
1. write API call in service
