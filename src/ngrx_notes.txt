selector is only to read the data and give a name to state

whenever we are going to deal with the data in component:
1. create a variable in state
2. create action for it with required props, createAction method takes a string and props
3. implement the necessary action in reducer
4. dispatch the action from component if data needs to stored in state
5. subscribe to the store if data is to be read
